LetX \u2192Bbe a family of smooth projective varieties (with fiber X), andY \u2192B a family of smooth subvarieties. Let \u02dcX \u2192Bdenote the blow-up of XalongY. ThenX \u2192B andY \u2192Bhave the Franchetta property if and only if \u02dcXhas the Franchetta property with respect to B. Proof. (IF direction) Let E\u2282\u02dcXbe the exceptional divisor of Y. Suppose that we have a family of diagrams over a scheme B: E/d31 /d127/d47/d47 /d15/d15\u02dcX /d15/d15 Y/d31 /d127/d47/d47 /d31/d31\u2745\u2745\u2745\u2745\u2745\u2745\u2745\u2745X /d15/d15 B, whereEis the exceptional divisor over Y.

(1) The fact that Yhas trivial Chow groups implies that the Chern classes are in jected into cohomology, and the condition (i)of Proposition 3.2 holds true. In order to prove condition (ii)of Proposition 3.2 we observe that, since Yhas trivial Chow groups, then the Chow ring of the product X\u00d7Ydecomposes as a finite direct sum of copies of the Chow ring of X, as follows: CH\u2217(X\u00d7Y) =\u2295iCH\u2217(X). The upshot is that the Franchetta property also holds for the productX\u00d7Y. To prove that the graph of the inclusion \u03b9:Y\u2192Xis of pure grade 0, we need to prove the vanishing \u039b := (\u03c0i X\u00d7\u03c0j Y)\u2217(\u0393\u03b9) = 0 inCHn(X\u00d7Y)\u2200i+j/ne}ationslash= 2n.

The Franchetta property for X \u00d7BYthen implies that \u039bis rationally equivalent to 0. This completes the proof of condition (ii)of Proposition 3.2 in case (1). (2) Let us first check condition (i)of Proposition 3.2. We need to ascertain the vanishing (\u03c0i Y)\u2217ck(NY/X) = 0 inCHk(Y)\u2200i/ne}ationslash= 2k ."

In order to show the Franchetta property for the family C-1, i t is enough to remark that each cubic surface Yinside a cubic fourfold Xis a linear section given by a P3\u2282P5. In fact the normal bundle of Yis the restriction to Yof the normal bundle of P3inP5. This in turn implies thatc1(NY/X) =h|Y. It follows that \u03b9\u2217c1(NY/X) =h3\u2208CH3(X), and the hypotheses of Lemma 4.2 are verified (we recall that cubic fourfolds have an MCK de composition by Theorem 2.9). Since the Franchetta property holds, Proposition 3.4 gives us the claimed MCK decomposition for the family C-1. 4.3. C-3. The second family, dubbed C-3 in [6], is given by zero loci of a section of O(1,2)\u2295 QP2(0,1)onP2\u00d7P5. These fourfolds are also described as the blow-up of a cubic fourfold in C8along a plane. Since Fano fourfolds from family C-3 are blow-ups of cubic fo urfoldsXalong a plane Y, and CH1(Y) =Q, we clearly have that \u03b9\u2217CH1(Y) = [Y]\u00b7h\u2282CH2(X)\u00b7CH1(X). We can thus apply Lemma 4.2 and obtain the Franchetta propert y forX. The rest of the proof is the same as for family C-1. 4.4. C-10. As explained in [6], Fano fourfolds in the family C-10 can be d escribed as blow-ups /tildewideXofXwith center Y, whereXis a Fano variety in the family C-1 and Yis the blow-up of a cubic surface in 3 points (obtained by intersecting the cubi c surface in P5with a general P3). It is readily seen that the normal bundle of YinXis the restriction of the normal bundle of a blown-up P3in a blown-up P5, and so c1(NY/X)\u2208Im/parenleftbig CH1(X)\u2192CH1(Y)/parenrightbig . The hypotheses of Lemma 4.2 are then satisfied, and so the fami lyX \u2192Bhas the Franchetta property."

It is known that Im/parenleftbig CH2(Gr(2,4)\u2192CH2(Y)/parenrightbig =Q (this follows from [45, First proof of Proposition 2.1]), an d so Proposition 4.4 guarantees the Franchetta property for Y \u2192B. As clearly Xhas trivial Chow groups, this gives the MCK decomposition for /tildewideX. 4.14. K3-40. HereM2=P1\u00d7P5and its Chow ring is generated by intersections of divisors. In view of Proposition 4.4, this directly implies the Franch etta property for the family Y \u2192B, whose members here are K3 surfaces of degree 8, blown up in 8 po ints. The fourfold Xis the blow-up of a 4-dimensional quadric along a 2-dimensiona l quadric, hence clearly has trivial Chow groups. Hence, we obtain a generically defined MCK decom position for /tildewideX. 4.15. K3-41. For this family M2=P1\u00d7P3, andXcoincides with M2. The fourfold Xhas trivial Chow groups and its Chow ring is generated by interse ctions of divisors. This implies the Franchetta property for the family Y \u2192Bof K3 surfaces, that in this case are bielliptic. The argument is the same as the preceding one. 4.16. K3-46. This case is similar to the two preceding ones. The K3 surface sY \u2192Bare some special degree 26 surfaces (see [6] for more details). In thi s case we have M2=P3\u00d7P5, hence its Chow ring is generated by intersections of divisors and t he Franchetta property follows for Y \u2192B. On the other hand Xis the blow up of a smooth quadric along a line, hence has trivi al Chow groups. One concludes as in K3-40 and K3-41. 4.17. K3-47. For Fano fourfolds of type K3-47, the family of surfaces is ma de up by deter- minantal quartic K3 surfaces. We have M2=P3\u00d7P3, and its Chow ring is thus generated by intersections of divisors. As before this implies the Fra nchetta property for the K3 family Y \u2192B."

A CONSEQUENCE FOR THE INTERSECTION PRODUCT Our Theorem 4.1 has some interesting consequences on the beh aviour of the intersection prod- uct with respect to the cycle class map. Not surprisingly, Fa no fourfolds that appear in Theorem 4.1 behave very much like K3 surfaces. Corollary 5.1. LetXbe one of the Fano fourfolds in Table 1. Then the image of the in tersection product map m: CH1(X)\u2297CH2(X)\u2192CH3(X) injects into cohomology. In other words, there are \u03c1:= dimH2(X,Q)distinguished 1-cycles \u21131,...,\u2113 \u03c1such that Im/parenleftBig CH1(X)\u2297CH2(X)\u2192CH3(X)/parenrightBig =\u03c1/circleplusdisplay i=1Q[\u2113i]."
