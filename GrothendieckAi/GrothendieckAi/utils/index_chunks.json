SURJECTIVITY OF THE PERIOD MAP AND GLOBAL TORELLI\nIn [217, Sec. 7] Griﬃths suggested to prove a Global Torelli Theorem for K3 surfaces by\ndirectly reconstructing the function ﬁeld of an algebraic K3 surface X from its period P(X, ϕ). Unfortunately, nothing along this line has ever been worked out. Concerning the diﬀerential topology of K3 surfaces, the two main open problems are the de-\nscription of the kernel of Diﬀ(X)\n/ O(H2(X, Z)) (see Question 5.8) and the description of the\ngroup of symplectomorphisms (up to isotopy) of a K3 surface X viewed as a manifold with a\nreal symplectic structure given by a Kähler form, cf. Seidel’s article [540]. The latter is related\nto the group of autoequivalences of the derived category Db(Coh(X)) via mirror symmetry, see\nChapter 16."

More precisely, if X and Y are two varieties over a ﬁeld k and Coh(X)\n∼\n−\n/\nCoh(Y ) is a k-linear equivalence, then X and Y are isomorphic varieties. The situation\nbecomes more interesting when instead of the abelian category Coh(X) one considers its\nbounded derived category Db(X). Then Gabriel’s theorem is no longer valid in general\nand, in fact, there exist non-isomorphic K3 surfaces X and Y with equivalent bounded de-\nrived categories. In this chapter we outline the main results concerning derived categories\nof coherent sheaves on K3 surfaces."

An immediate consequence of the Tate conjecture is that the Picard number\nof a K3 surface over a ﬁnite ﬁeld is always even, see Corollary 2.9. Here is another\nconsequence\nCorollary 3.7. Let X be a K3 surface over an algebraically closed ﬁeld of characteristic\n≥3. Then X is supersingular if and only if ρ(X) = 22. Proof. Since ρ(X) ≤22−2h(X) for K3 surfaces of ﬁnite height, see Lemma 18.3.6,\nany K3 surfaces of maximal Picard number ρ(X) = 22 has to be supersingular. For the\nconverse assume that X is deﬁned over a ﬁnite ﬁeld Fq."
