The pairing is compatible with base change, so one can pass to algebraically closed fields once the trace map is shown to exist over k.

Therefore, (2.5) yields 0\u0015 (X;L) = (1=2)(L)2+ 2and thus (L)2<0. In particular, Lcannot be numerically trivial and, hence, Pic(X)\u0018\u0000 //NS(X)\u0018\u0000 //Num(X). Moreover, the intersection form is negativedefiniteontheorthogonalcomplementofanyamplelinebundle,whichprovesthe claim on the signature.

However, if 06=s2H0(X;L), then 06=sk2H0(X;Lk)for allk>0and, moreover, the zero sets of both sections coincide. Thus, if Lkis trivial, also Lis trivial.

See Remark 8.1.3. 10In the case of algebraic K3 surfaces over an arbitrary base field k(in which case clearly 1\u0014\u001a(X)) one can replace singular cohomology by \u00e9tale cohomology and finds the upper bound \u001a(X)\u001422, see Remark 3.7.

The singular points are all ordinary double points and the minimal resolution X //Ydefines a K3 surface. Moreover, such a surface has 16tropes, i.e. tangent planes that are tangent along a conic in Y. Each trope contains exactly six of the singular points and each singular point is contained in exactly six tropes. The configuration of the 16points and 16tropes is called a (16;6)configuration which in fact determines the quartic uniquely. Due to work of Nikulin [ 446] (cf. Remark 14.3.19), it is known that the minimal resolution Xis in fact a Kummer surface in the sense of Examples 1.3, iii).

This is Ramanujam\u2019s lemma , which in characteristic zero holds true even without the assumption H1(X;O) = 0. Remark 3.3. The vanishing can be used to study linear systems. Let us here give a glimpse of a standard technique which almost shows base point freeness of an ample linear system, see also Proposition 3.5. SupposeLis a big and nef line bundle on a K3 surface X.

Compare this to Corollary 3.15, where it is shown that Lis in fact base point free. Indeed, by Proposition 3.1 one has H1(X;M ) = 0 =H1(X;L). Hence, (M) = h0(M) =h0(L) = (L). Thus, from the Riemann\u2013Roch formula one concludes (M)2= (L)2and hence 2(M:F) + (F)2= 0. Now,Lnef yields (M:F) + (F)2= (L:F)\u00150and, therefore, (M:F) = (F)2= 0. Then the Riemann\u2013Roch formula applied to F6= 0leads to the contradiction 1 =h0(F)\u0015 (F) = 2. Hence,F= 0. Remark 3.4. SupposeLis a big and nef line bundle."

E\ufb00ectiveversionsofit(incharacteristic zero) have been found by Demailly, Siu and others, see [ 355]. Related to the question for polarized K3 surfaces of prescribed degree is the question which degree and genus can be realized by a smooth curve on a quartic. This has been addressed by Mori in [ 420]. Questions and open problems: It is natural to wonder how much of the theory generalizes to higher dimensions. For example, ifLis an ample line bundle on a projective irreducible symplectic variety X, is thenL2globally generated and L3very ample? Similarly, is Xdescribed by quadratic equations? The first case to study would be the Hilbert scheme of length two subschemes of a K3 surface."

However, for non-projective Xthe sum need not be direct nor the inclusion of finite index. 3.1.Recall that the transcendental part, integral or rational, of a Hodge structure of K3 type is the minimal primitive sub-Hodge structure of K3 type, see Definition 2.5. Alternatively, one has: Lemma 3.1. The transcendental lattice of a complex K3 surface is the orthogonal complement of the N\u00e9ron\u2013Severi group: T(X) = NS(X)?: IfXis projective, then T(X)is a polarizable irreducible Hodge structure, cf. Lemma 2.7. 2In [561] Shioda shows that in characteristic p>0one still has disc NS(X) =\u000064forp\u00111(4)(and \u001a(X) = 20), but disc NS(X) =\u0000p2forp\u00113(4)(and\u001a(X) = 22), cf. Sections 17.2.3. Are lines still generating NS(X)?"

Geometrically, K3 surfaces of this type are provided by elliptic K3 surfaces without any multisection. For a concrete algebraic example consider V=Q4with diagonal intersection form (1;2;1;\u00001). Then let `=e1+e4andV2;0be spanned by \u001b:= (e2+ `) +i(p 2e3+`). One easily checks that h`i?in this case is spanned by e2;e3;`. Due to thep 2in the definition of \u001b, the class`is indeed the only Hodge class up to scaling. In a similar fashion, one constructs examples of complex K3 surfaces with Pic(X) spanned by a line bundle Lwith (L)2<0. 3.2.Let us next note the following elementary but very useful statement. Lemma 3.3. LetTbe a rational (or integral) Hodge structure of K3 type, such that there is no proper (primitive) sub-Hodge structure 06=T0\u001aTof K3 type. If a:T //T is any endomorphism of the Hodge structure with a= 0onT2;0, thena= 0. Proof. By assumption, T0:= Ker(a)\u001aTis a Hodge structure with T02;06= 0(and T=T0torsion free). Hence, T0=Tand soa= 0. \u0003"

In [202] van Geemen shows that any totally real field Kis realized as K(T)of a polarized rational Hodge structure Tof K3 type. Moreover, m:= dimKT\u00153 can be prescribed. If m\u0001[K:Q]\u001410, thenKis realized as K(T(X))of the general memberXof an (m\u00002)-dimensional family of K3 surfaces. Pjatecki\u02d8 \u0131-\u0160apiro and \u0160afarevi\u010d show in [ 491] that any CM field Kwith [K:Q]\u001416 can be realized as K(T(X))of a K3 surfaces which moreover satisfies dimKT= 1or, equivalently, dimQT= [K:Q], see (3.2). The condition on the degree has recently be weakened by Taelman to [K:Q]\u001420, see [579]. Note that dimKT1implies that Kis a CM field, see Remark 3.14."

If Vis of type (1;\u00001)+(0;0)+ (\u00001;1)with dimV1;\u00001= 1, then also Cl\u0006(V)is of type (1;\u00001) + (0;0) + (\u00001;1). This is later applied to H2(X;Z(1))of a K3 surface X. 2. From weight two to weight one We start with a Hodge structure Vof K3 type, see Definition 3.2.3, and assume that Vis endowed with a polarization \u0000q. The first step is to construct a natural complex structure on the real vector space Cl+(VR)which can be interpreted as a Hodge structure of weight one. The second step consists of constructing a polarization for this new Hodge structure of weight one."

The quadratic form qis in this case given by the standard intersection pairing which is positive definite on (H2;0\bH0;2)(X)\\H2(X;R). Definition 2.9. TheKuga\u2013Satake variety KS(X)ofX, for now just a complex torus, is defined as the Kuga\u2013Satake variety associated with H2(X;Z): KS(X):= KS(H2(X;Z)): There are variants of this construction. The Kuga\u2013Satake construction can also be applied to the transcendental lattice T(X), see Definition 3.2.5. This yields another complex torus KS(T(X))naturally associated with H2(X;Z). Note that KS(T(X))is a complex torus of (complex) dimension 2rkT(X)\u00002. For example, if Xis a K3 surface of maximal Picard number \u001a(X) = 20, then KS(T(X))is an elliptic curve. ReplacingT(X)by any other lattice T(X)\u001aT(X)0yields a complex torus KS(T(X)0). IfT(X)Qis a direct summand of T(X)0 Q, for example when T(X)0is polarizable, then KS(T(X)0)is isogenous to KS(T(X))2dwithd= rk(T(X)0=T(X)), see Example 2.4. In particular, if H2(X;Z)is polarizable, then KS(X)\u0018KS(T(X))2\u001a with\u001a=\u001a(X)is the Picard number of X. IfXis projective and `2H2(X;Z)is an ample class, one could also consider T(X)0:=`?=H2(X;Z)p, the primitive cohomology of(X;`). Then KS(X;`):= KS(`?) is a complex torus naturally associated with the polarized surface (X;`). Note that the intersection form really is a polarization of `?=H2(X;Z)p(up to sign) and, therefore, KS(X;`)is an abelian variety. Moreover, there are natural isogenies KS(X)\u0018KS(X;`)2\u0018KS(T(X))2\u001a:"

Then the class \u0014Xis algebraic. The conjecture applies to K3 surfaces as well as to abelian surfaces. Clearly, the above form is equivalent to the analogous one for the transcendental lattices.

Appendix: Weil conjectures The Weil conjectures occupy a very special place in the history of algebraic geometry. They have motivated large parts of modern algebraic geometry. For a short survey with a historical account see [ 234, App. C] or [ 293]. The rationality of the Zeta function and its functional equation had been proved by Dwork by 1960. The analogue of the Riemann hypothesis was eventually proved by Deligne in 1974, who had verified it for K3 surfaces a few years earlier [ 139]. The argu- ments in the case of K3 surfaces, in particular the use of the Kuga\u2013Satake construction, 1I am grateful to Matthias Sch\u00fctt for clarifying comments regarding this point."

Is there a more explicit proof of the algebraicity of the Kuga\u2013Satake correspondence for abelian surfaces than the one that uses the full Hodge conjecture for self-products of abelian surfaces, see Remark 3.2? At this point it seems unlikely that the transcendental construction of the Kuga\u2013Satake variety can be replaced by an algebro-geometric one. Grothendieck at some point wondered whether maybe every variety is dominated by a product of curves (DPC). If that were true, one could prove the Weil conjectures (in fact also the Tate conjecture, see Remark 17.3.3) by reducing to the case of curves. In a letter to Grothendieck in 1964, Serre produced a counterexample in dimension two [ 125]. His surface is realized as a subvariety of an abelian variety and is in particular not a K3 surface. In fact, it is not known whether there exist K3 surfaces that are not DPC. More example of varieties that are not DPC were constructed by Schoen in [ 528]."

His arguments rely on Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT), but without actually proving that points in the appropriate Hilbert scheme corresponding to K3 surfaces are stable. In [ 425] Ian Morrison proves that the generic K3 surface defines a GIT stable point if d\u00156. Theorem 1.1. ForS= Spec(C)the moduli functor Mdcan be coarsely represented by a quasi-projective variety Md.3 See Section 2.3 for more details and comments on the case of positive characteristic. 1.2.The existence of aquasi-projective coarse moduli spaceis farfrom being trivial, using periods or GIT. However, the existence of the coarse moduli space as an algebraic space is much easier and follows from very general existence results for group quotients in the category of algebraic spaces. Theorem 1.2. The moduli functor Mdcan be coarsely represented by a separated algebraic space Mdwhich is locally of finite type over S. 3From this and Theorem 1.2 one can conclude that Mdadmits a quasi-projective coarse moduli space over any field of characteristic zero. The only thing that needs checking is that the algebraic space coarsely representing Mdoverkcan be completed to a complete algebraic space. This is provided by the Nagata compactification theorem, see [ 127]. Then use that a complete algebraic space that becomes projective after base field extension is itself projective."

The result of Keel and Mori [ 287] in fact shows that any separated Deligne\u2013Mumford stack of finite type has a coarse moduli space in the category of algebraic spaces. This gives back Theorem 1.2 (however, relying on essentially the same techniques). As explained by Rizov in [ 507], taking into account automorphisms of polarized K3 surfaces resolves the singularities of the moduli stack. More precisely, one can show thatMdis a smooth Deligne\u2013Mumford stack over Spec(Z[1=(2d)]), cf.

Moreover, for any algebraically closed field kit induces a bijection H(k)=G(k)\u0018\u0000 //Q(k).

    "text": "In our geometric situation and, in particular, for the construction of the moduli space of K3 surfaces, one could try to rigidify the situation by introducing addi- tional structures (level structures), e.g. one would consider every K3 surface together with all isomorphisms H2(X;Z=`Z)'\u0003=`\u0003. This produces a finite \u00e9tale covering eH //H with Galois group say \u0000and such that the PGL-action on Hlifts naturally to a free action oneH. Then the existence of eH=PGLas a scheme is easier and this quotient can be used as an \u00e9tale cover of Mdas required in (ii). Another advantage of eH=PGLover H=PGLis the existence of a universal family. See Section 6.4.2 for more details on this approach (in the complex setting). However, as an alternative to the approach sketched in the last remark one can use the following result, see [ 144, Thm. 4.21] and also [ 160] or [54, Ch. 5]. Theorem 4.9. LetMbe a quasi-separated stack over a Noetherian scheme S. Then Mis a Deligne\u2013Mumford stack if (iii)The diagonal \u0001:M //M\u0002 (Sch=S )Mis unramified and (iv)There exists a scheme Uof finite type over Sand a smooth surjective morphism U //M(overS).13 This can be used to prove Theorem 1.3, which we state again as Proposition 4.10. The stackMdof primitively polarized K3 surfaces of degree 2d over a Noetherian base Sis a Deligne\u2013Mumford stack. 12Often, the separatedness of the diagonal is added as an additional condition and not seen as part of the definition. 13In a certain sense, the existence of Uin(iv)is an analogue (less precise) of Luna\u2019s \u00e9tale slice theorem mentioned in the proof of Corollary 3.6. The existence of Uas in (iv)suggests to take \u00e9tale sections to produce the \u00e9tale covering in (ii). Note however, that in general one cannot find an \u00e9tale slice through every point of a smooth atlas U //M, see [ 54, Ex. 5.7]. Also note that if Uin(iv)is smooth, then also the \u00e9tale atlas in (ii)can be chosen smooth."

Note that \u0003d'E8(\u00001)\b2\bU\b2\bZ(\u00002d), see Example 14.1.11. An example withn+= 4is provided by the full cohomology H\u0003(X;Z)of a complex K3 surface X. For the necessary lattice theory, in particular all the notations, we refer to . 1.1.Consider the associated complex vector space \u0003C:= \u0003 ZCendowed with the C-linear extension of (:)which corresponds to a homogenous quadratic polynomial. Its zero locus in P(\u0003C)is a quadric which is smooth due to the assumption that (:)is non-degenerate. Consider the open (in the classical topology) subset of this quadric D:=fx2P(\u0003C)j(x)2= 0;(x:\u0016x)>0g\u001aP(\u0003C); to which we refer as the period domain associated with \u0003and which is considered as a complex manifold. Note that the second condition really is well posed, as (\u0015x:\u0015x) = (\u0015\u0016\u0015)(x:\u0016x)and\u0015\u0016\u00152R>0for all\u00152C\u0003. Also note that Ditself only depends on the real vector space \u0003Rtogether with the real linear extension of (:). 99"

Thus, it stays constant for points t2Sfor which the space of Hodge classes on all powers Xm tis minimal. Due to the result of Cattani, Deligne,"

Also note that the abelian scheme a:A //S0is very special as it comes with complex multiplication provided by the action of C. 5. Appendix: Kulikov models The moduli space of polarized (or just quasi-polarized) K3 surfaces is not proper and it is an important and interesting problem to compactify it naturally, for example by allowing singular degenerations of K3 surfaces. The easiest case are one-dimensional degenerations. This leads to the notion of Kulikov models. In this appendix we survey the theory of Kulikov models and mention a few additional results. 5.1.Consider a one-dimensional degeneration of K3 surfaces. More precisely, let X //\u0001\u001aC be a proper, flat, surjective morphism from a smooth threefold Xto a one-dimensional disk \u0001such that all fibres Xt,t6= 0, are K3 surfaces, and so in particular are smooth. The central fibre X0can be arbitrarily singular, reducible, and even non-reduced. Amodification ofX //\u0001is a family of the same type X0 //\u0001(so in particular X0 is smooth), such that there exists a birational morphism X //X0;which is compat- ible with the projections to \u0001and an isomorphism over \u0001\u0003. The degeneration is called semistable if the special fibre X0is reduced with local normal crossings. After base change \u0001 //\u0001,z //zm, every degeneration X //\u0001admits a modification that is semistable. This is a consequence of a general result for degenerations of smooth varieties due to Mumford [ 288, Ch. II]. Most of it follows from Hironaka\u2019s resolution of singularities, the hard part is to get the central fibre reduced. Note that Mumford\u2019s result actually yields a semistable degeneration such that the irreducible components of X0=SYiare smooth, i.e. X0has strict normal crossing. However, this property may not survive the next step."

Thus, deformation equivalent complex manifolds are in particular di\ufb00eomorphic. The converse is in general not true, i.e. there exist di\ufb00eomorphic compact complex manifolds which are not deformation equivalent. However, producing explicit examples is not easy.1 For K3 surfaces, all topological invariants like Betti numbers and intersection form are independent of the particular K3 surface. In fact, even the Hodge numbers hp;q(X)do not depend on X. This may be seen as evidence for the following theorem of Kodaira [306, Thm. 13], which in particular shows that all complex K3 surfaces can be realized by some complex structure Ion a fixed di\ufb00erentiable manifold Mof dimension four, for example the di\ufb00erentiable manifold underlying a smooth quartic in P3. Theorem 1.1. Any two complex K3 surfaces are deformation equivalent. 1In fact, two di\ufb00eomorphic algebraic surfaces which are not of general type are deformation equiva- lent, see [ 184]. However, this does not hold any longer for surfaces of general type. For simply connected counterexamples see [ 105]. 125"

This is extended multiplicatively to O(\u0003R)by writing any gas a composition of reflections s\u000e, which is possible due to the Cartan\u2013Dieudonn\u00e9 theorem, see e.g. [ 15, 497]. We let O+(\u0003)\u001aO(\u0003) be the index two subgroup of orthogonal transformations of spinor norm +1or, equiv- alently, the subgroup of all orthogonal transformations preserving any given orientation of the three positive directions in \u0003R. A classical result essentially due to Wall and later improved by Ebeling and Kneser (see Theorem 14.2.2) asserts that any g2O+(\u0003)can be written as a productQs\u000eiwith\u000ei2\u0003such that (\u000ei)2=\u00002. Asaconsequenceofthisabstractresultfororthogonaltransformationsof \u0003, oneobtains a description of the monodromy group. Proposition 5.5. The monodromy group Mon(X)\u001aO(H2(X;Z))of a K3 surface X coincides with the index two subgroup O+(H2(X;Z))of all transformations with trivial spinor norm. In particular, O(H2(X;Z))=Mon(X) =f\u00061g. Proof. It su\ufb03ces to show that any reflection s\u000eassociated with a (\u00002)-class\u000e2\u0003 can be realized by a monodromy transformation.2The argument goes roughly as follows: FixMand a class \u000e2H2(M;Z)with (\u000e)2=\u00002. We use the surjectivity of the period map (see Theorem 4.1) to show that there exists a complex structure IonMsuch that forX= (M;I)one hasH1;1(X;Z) =Z\u000e. Under these conditions there exists a unique smooth rational curve P1'C\u001aXwith [C] =\u0006\u000e. Indeed, the Riemann\u2013Roch formula for the line bundle Lcorresponding to \u000eshows (L) = 1and soH0(X;L)6= 0 2This is a folklore result, see e.g. [ 182] or [395], where the argument is presumably explained in detail."

In both proofs the Global Torelli Theorem is firstly and rather directly shown for Kum- mer surfaces. The idea is that a complex torus A=C2=\u0000is determined by its Hodge structure of weight one H1(A;Z)and when passing to the Hodge structure of weight two H2(A;Z) =V2H1(A;Z)not much of the information is lost (in fact, only Aand its dual torus have isomorphic Hodge structures of weight two, see Section 3.2.4). The associated Kummer surface contains H2(A;Z)as the orthogonal complement of the additional 16 (\u00002)-classes (see Section 3.2.5) and one needs to control those in order to conclude. The di\ufb03cult part is to pass from Kummer surfaces, which are dense in the moduli space (see Remark14.3.24), to arbitrary K3 surfaces. We refrain from presenting the classical proof, as several very detailed account of it exist in the literature, see e.g. Looijenga\u2019s article [376] or the expositions in [ 32, 53]. 5:::as was pointed out to me by Andrey Soldatenkov."

Unfortunately, nothing along this line has ever been worked out. Concerning the di\ufb00erential topology of K3 surfaces, the two main open problems are the de- scription of the kernel of Di (X) //O(H2(X;Z))(see Question 5.8) and the description of the group of symplectomorphisms (up to isotopy) of a K3 surface Xviewed as a manifold with a real symplectic structure given by a K\u00e4hler form, cf.

The first inequality (together with the Riemann\u2013Roch theorem) implies that some positive multiple of Lis e\ufb00ective, whereas the latter would then contradict the nefness of : iii) The two inequalities ( )2>0and( :C)>0in (1.1) also describe the ample cone Amp(X)and not only the integral classes in Amp(X). Every class 2Amp(X) satisfies these inequalities, but the converse is not obvious. Any class satisfying (1.1) is contained in a polyhedral cone spanned by rational classes 0arbitrarily close to . We may assume that they all satisfy ( 0)2>0. However, a priori there could be a sequence"

Then for any Nthere are at most finitely many curves P1'C\u001aXwith (C:H)\u0014N. The same holds for H replaced by any real ample class 2Amp(X). Proof. This is in fact an abstract result that has nothing to do with K3 surfaces. It has essentially been proved already in Section 2.2, see Remark 2.3. Nevertheless, we prove it again, and, moreover, in two di\ufb00erent ways. i) Since (C)2=\u00002for anyP1'C\u001aX, fixing (C:H)is equivalent to fixing the Hilbert polynomial of C\u001aX. Now, the Hilbert scheme of all subvarieties of Xwith fixed Hilbert polynomialisaprojectivescheme. Assmoothintegralrationalcurvesdonotdeform, they correspond to connected components of the projective Hilbert scheme, of which there exist only finitely many ones. Hence, there are only finitely many P1'C\u001aXwith fixed (C:H). ii) Alternatively, one could use the following purely numerical argument. The given ample class Hcan be completed to an orthogonal basis of NS(X)R'R\u001asuch that the quadratic form is (H)2x2 1\u0000x2 2\u0000:::\u0000x2 \u001a.

To exclude that (C: )gets arbitrarily small use the arguments in Section 2.2. \u0003 The next immediate consequence, at least its second part, has also been proved ab- stractly already in Proposition 2.4.

Thepositive cone of the complex K3 surface Xis the connected component CX\u001aH1;1(X;R) of the open setf 2H1;1(X;R)j( )2>0gthat containsKX. Note that the inclusion (5.1) NS(X)R=H1;1(X;Z)R\u001aH1;1(X;R) is in general strict. In fact, for very general Xone has NS(X) = 0. Equality in (5.1) only holds for K3 surfaces of Picard number \u001a(X) = 20. Observe thatKXandCXare open convex cones of real dimension 20independent of X, whereas the dimension of Amp(X) depends on \u001a(X). Under the inclusion (5.1), one has Amp(X) =KX\\NS(X)Rby Kodaira\u2019s characteri- zation of positive classes (cf. [ 219, 251, 617 ]) andCX\\NS(X)Rgives back the positive cone in NS(X)R(for which we used the same notation). Recall that Xis projective if and only ifKXcontains an integral class or, equivalently, if CXcontains an integral class, see Remark 1.3. The following is the K\u00e4hler analogue of Corollary 1.7. Theorem 5.2. The K\u00e4hler cone KXis described by (5.2)KX=f 2H1;1(X;R)j 2CXand( :C)>0for allP1'C\u001aXg: Moreover, if is in the boundary of KX, then ( )2= 0or there exists a P1'C\u001aX with ( :C) = 0."

See [ 355, Ch. 2.2]. Also the big cone admits a chamber decomposition. In fact, it admits two. Firstly, one can look at the Weyl chambers , which by definitions are the connected components of Big(X)nS[C]?, where the union is over all P1' C\u001aX. Clearly, onCX\u001aBig(X)this gives back the classical chamber decomposition. Secondly, one can consider the decomposition into Zariski chambers . By definition, two big divisors L1;L2 are contained in the same Zariski chamber if the negative part in the Zariski decomposition of L1are the (\u00002)-curves with (L2:C) = 0(see page 37). These two notions have been compared carefully in [ 38]. In particular, it is shown that the two decompositions coincide if and only if one cannot find two (\u00002)-curvesC1;C2with (C1:C2) = 1."

For later reference, we record the special cases: v(k(x)) = (0;0;1); v(OX) = (1;0;1);andv(L) = (1;c1(L);c2 1(L)=2 + 1) forL2Pic(X). In order to express (E;F)as an intersection of Mukai vectors, one introduces the Mukai pairing . This can be done for arbitrary K3 surfaces (see Section 16.2.4), but for complex K3 surfaces it can be most conveniently phrased using singular cohomology. Definition 1.4. For a complex K3 surface XtheMukai pairing onH\u0003(X;Z)is h ; i= ( 2: 2)\u0000( 0: 4)\u0000( 4: 0); where (:)denotes the usual intersection form on H\u0003(X;Z). In other words, the Mukai pairing di\ufb00ers from the intersection form only by a sign in the pairing on H0\bH4. See also Section 1.3.3, where (:)was only considered on H2(X;Z). With this definition, the Hirzebruch\u2013Riemann\u2013Roch formula (1.3) becomes (1.4) (E;F) =\u0000hv(E);v(F)i:"

In Section 5.3, the local structure of the moduli space of polar- ized K3 surfaces was approached by first embedding all K3 surfaces in question into a projective space and then applying the deformation theory for Hilbert schemes. In Sec- tion6.2.3, deformation theory of general compact complex manifolds was reviewed and then applied to complex K3 surfaces without polarization. Building up on this, Section 6.2.4 explained how to deal with the polarized case. 10For simplicity, we assume char(k)>3, otherwise one would also have to deal with quasi-elliptic fibrations."

General theory Most of the material recalled in this first section is covered by [ 264]. 1.1.LetXbe a smooth projective variety over a field kwhich for simplicity we assume algebraically closed. The moduli space of sheaves that is best understood is the Picard scheme PicXrepresenting the functor (Sch=k)o //(Sets)mapping a k-schemeS to the setfL2Pic(S\u0002X)g=\u0018, whereL\u0018L p\u0003Mfor allM2Pic(S), see e.g. [80, 174]. In particular, the k-rational points of PicXform the Picard group Pic(X). The Picard scheme itself is neither projective nor of finite type, but it decomposes as PicX=G PicP X with projective components. Here, PicP Xparametrizes line bundles on Xwith fixed Hilbert polynomial P2Q[t]with respect to a chosen ample line bundle O(1)onX. Note that the Hilbert polynomial P(L;m):= (X;L(m))of a line bundle on Xcan be computed via the Hirzebruch\u2013Riemann\u2013Roch formula as (X;L(m)) =Z ch(L)ch(O(m))td(X): Obviously, the expression only depends on c1(L)and(X;O(1)). The naive question this theory raises is the following: If one generalizes the Picard functorasabovetothefunctorofhigherrankvectorbundlesorarbitrarycoherentsheaves, is the resulting functor again representable? The following two examples immediately show that care is needed when leaving the realm of line bundles. Example 1.1. Consider onP1the bundles En:=O(n)\bO(\u0000n),n>0. First observe thath0(En) =n+ 1."

Questions and open problems: It is still an open question whether moduli spaces of stable sheaves on a fixed K3 surface, maybe with additional conditions on the prescribed Mukai vectors, are derived equivalent as soon as their dimensions coincide. This is even open for cases where the moduli spaces are known to be birational (except for dimension two and four). The link between the Brauer groups of a K3 surface and of a non-fine moduli space as expressed by (2.1) has only been proved using Hodge theory and so is a priori only valid for complex projective K3 surfaces. Is there a purely algebraic argument for it?"

This could also be concluded directly from Zariski\u2019s connectedness principle, see [ 234, III.Exer. 11.4] or [373, Thm. 5.3.15], or even more directly from h0(Xt;OXt) = 1. Suppose a fibre Xtis of the form mC,m\u00152(withCpossibly reducible). Then use 0 //O((m\u00001)C) //O(Xt) //O(Xt)jC//0; O(Xt)jC'OC,h0(X;O(Xt)) =h0(P1;O(1)) = 2 , and the fact that the composition H0(P1;O(1)) //H0(X;O(Xt)) //H0(C;O)isnotzero,todeduce h0(X;O((m\u00001)C)) = 1. But by Riemann\u2013Roch (X;O((m\u00001)C)) = 2, as(C)2= (1=m)2(Xt)2= 0, and hence h0(X;O((m\u00001)C))\u00152, forh2(X;O((m\u00001)C)) = 0form\u00152. Contradiction. (See also Remark 2.3.13 for a slightly di\ufb00erent proof.) For Zariski\u2019s lemma use that for any fibre O(Xt)jXt'OXt. So,O(Xt)jCi'OCiand thus (Ci:Xt) = 0. The second assertion can be rephrased by saying that the intersection form is semi-negative definite onLZ[Ci]with radicalPmi[Ci]. The first part can be seen as a consequence of the Hodge index theorem, see Section 1.2.3. To prove the full statement, we introduce the notation cij:= (Ci:Cj)andaij:=mimjcij. Clearly,aij\u00150 fori6=jandP jaij= (miCi:Xt) = 0for fixediand similarlyP iaij= 0for fixedj.

In particular, there can be at most two fibres of type III\u0003. The generic elliptic K3 surfaces has only singular fibres of type I1(see [184, I.1.4]) and exactly 24of those: 24 = 24\u0001e(I1). In Example 1.11, i) we found 24 = 4\u0001e(I\u0003 0). In [414] Miranda and Persson study elliptic K3 surfaces (with a section) with fibres of type Inionly. (These fibres are the only semistable fibres and so elliptic K3 surfaces of this type are called semistable.) Now, combine the Shioda\u2013Tate formula, see Corollary 3.4, with equation (1.1), which in this case readsPni= 24. One finds that there are at least six singular fibres. It turns out that there are 1242tuples (n1;:::;ns),s\u00156, withPni= 24and all except for 135can indeed be realized. See also [ 412, X.4]. 2. Weierstrass equation Every elliptic surface with a section can be reconstructed from its Weierstrass model. We present the beautiful theory for K3 surfaces only. For details and the general situation the reader is referred to [ 280, 411 ]."

Then, Jacd(E)(see Section 4.1) admits canonically the structure of an E0-torsor, i.e. Jacd(E)2WC(Jac(E)): Usingthegroupstructureof WC(E0)andwriting E'Jac1(E),onefindsthat [Jacd(E)] = d\u0001[E]2WC(E0). Indeed, Jacd1(E)\u0002Jacd2(E) //Jacd1+d2(E),(L;M ) //L Msatisfies the above property with respect to the natural action of Jac(E). The Weil\u2013Ch\u00e2telet group can be defined more generally for any group scheme, e.g. for the smooth part X0 tof a singular fibre Xtof an elliptic K3 surface \u0019:X //P1, see Section 2.5. So, in particular, one can speak of WC(X0 t). However, over an algebraically closed fieldkthis group is trivial and only when put in families it becomes interesting. It leads to the notion of the Weil\u2013Ch\u00e2telet group of an elliptic surface, see below. 5.2.Let\u0019:X0//P1be an elliptic K3 surface with a section C0\u001aX0. We shall work over an algebraically closed field k, but the arguments remain valid for k=Fq. Consider the open set X0 0\u001aX0of\u0019-smooth points as a group scheme X0 0//P1, see Section 2.5. A torsor under X0 0is defined similarly to the absolute case as a smooth fibrationX0 //P1with a group action X0 0\u0002P1X0 //X0; making the fibres X0 ttorsors under (X0 0)t. The set of all X0 0-torsors is the Weil\u2013Ch\u00e2telet group ofX0, but due to the absence of multiple fibres, it equals the Tate\u2013\u0160afarevi\u010d group ofX0and we shall, therefore, not distinguish between the two."

Let us elaborate on this a little more. Fibrewise multiplication by nyields a short exact sequence 0 //X0[n] //X0//X0//0; whereX0[n]is the sheaf of sections through n-torsion points in the fibres. Taking the long exact cohomology sequence gives the exact sequence 0 //MW(X0)=n\u0001MW(X0) //H1(P1;X0[n]) //X(X0)[n] //0: Here, X(X0)[n]\u001a X(X0)is the subgroup of elements of order dividing n. The coho- mologyH1(P1;X0[n])linking MW(X0)and X(X0)is the analogue of the Selmer group of an elliptic curve for the elliptic K3 surface \u0019:X0//P1. So one could introduce Sn(X0):=H1(P1;X0[n]) and call it the Selmer group of the elliptic surface \u0019:X0//P1. Remark 5.9. For 2 X(X0), let\u0019:X //P1be the associated elliptic K3 surface together with the natural isomorphism J(X )'X0. The techniques in the proof of Proposition 5.6 yield an exact sequence, see also [ 225, (4.35)] or [ 20, Prop. 1.6], 0 //X0//R1\u0019\u0003Gm=vert//Z //0; which splits for trivial . For general , taking cohomology one obtains an exact sequence Pic(X ) //Z //X(X0) //H1(P1;R1\u0019\u0003G=vert): Bydefinition, theimageof Pic(X ) //Zisgeneratedbytheindex d0andtheboundary of\u001612Z=d0Zyields 2 X(X0). In particular, d0is the order of 2 X(X0)'Br(X0).

This yields new elliptic surfaces and one checks that their classes in Xan(X0)'H2(X0;O\u0003 X0)are given by the image under the exponential mapH2(X0;OX0) //H2(X0;O\u0003 X0). It is worth noting that the family constructed in this way really is a family of elliptic surfaces, i.e. it comes with compatible projections to P1. Also note that this approach to Xan(X0)shows that all elliptic surfaces X //P1in Xan(X0)(and so in particular all in X(X0)) are deformation equivalent to X0//P1and, therefore, are K3 surfaces as well. This is an alternative argument for Proposition 5.4 when k=C. In this family, the algebraic surfaces are dense, because X(X0)'(Q=Z)22\u0000\u001a(X0)\u001a Xan(X0)'C=Z22\u0000\u001a(X0) induced by H2(X0;Q) \u007f//H2(X0;R) // //H2(X0;OX0)'Cis dense. References and further reading: In practice, it can be very di\ufb03cult to determine or describe all elliptic fibrations of a given K3 surface. This is only partially due to the automorphism group. For Kummer surfaces associated with the Jacobian Jac(C)of a generic genus two curve Cthis was recently studied in detail by Kumar in [ 337].

Questions and open problems: To the best of my knowledge, not all of the statements for complex elliptic K3 surfaces that should hold as well in positive characteristic have actually been worked out in full detail, see e.g. Remarks 3.11 and 4.10. It would be interesting to compute periods of non-projective (X //P1)2 Xan(X0). As mentioned in Section 4.3, there are things left to check to view Jd(X)as moduli space of sheaves in the non-algebraic setting."

Ifkis separably closed, then CH2(X)is torsion free. Proof. SeeRoitman\u2019soriginalarticle[ 509]andBloch\u2019sversion[ 65,66]showingthat there is no torsion prime to the characteristic. The general statement was established by Milne [404]. A brief account was given by Colliot-Th\u00e9l\u00e8ne in [ 120], but see also Voisin\u2019s [617, Sec. 22.1.2] in the complex setting. \u0003 Summarizing, for a K3 surface over an algebraically closed field the Chow groups CH0(X)'Z;CH1(X)'Pic(X) = NS(X)'Z\u001a(X);andCH2(X) are torsion free. Moreover, the degree map yields an exact sequence 0 //CH2(X)0//CH2(X) //Z //0 with CH2(X)0a divisible group. Remark1.4. Thetorsionof CH2(Y)forarbitrarysurfaceshasbeenstudiedintensively. For a survey see [ 120]. We only briefly mention the following results applicable to K3 surfaces. So, we shall assume that Xis a K3 surface over an arbitrary field k, although the following results hold under more general assumptions. i) If`is prime to the characteristic of k, then CH2(X)[`1](the part of CH2(X)anni- hilated by some power of `) is a subquotient of H3 \u0013et(X;Q`=Z`(2)), see [120, Thm. 3.3.2]. ii) Ifkis a finite field, then the torsion subgroup of CH2(X)is finite, cf. [ 120, Thm. 5.2] and [124]. See also Proposition 2.16, asserting that in fact CH2(X)is torsion free in this situation."

The image dimension of \u001bis defined as dim(Im(\u001bn)):= dim(Sn(X)\u0002Sn(X))\u0000fn= 4n\u0000fn: The following result then says that the \u2018dimension\u2019 of CH2(X)0is infinite. Theorem 2.3 (Mumford) .For a complex K3 surface Xone has lim dim(Im( \u001bn)) =1: Proof. The key idea is the following. The fibres of \u001bnare countable unions of subvarieties. The generator of H0(X; 2 X)induces a non-degenerate regular two-form on Xn\u0002Xnwhichissymmetricandhencedescendstoagenericallynon-degeneratetwo-form onSn(X)\u0002Sn(X). (Restrict to the smooth part to avoid the singularities.) Morally (but not literally!), the components of the fibres of \u001bntend to be rationally connected, for they parametrize rationally equivalent cycles. Since a rationally connected variety does not admit any non-trivial two-form (see [ 310, IV Cor. 3.8]), the components of the fibres should be of dimension at most (1=2) dim(Sn(X)\u0002Sn(X)). \u0003"

ThoseincludeellipticK3surfaces, Kummer surfaces, and quartic hypersurfaces. For example, for a quartic X\u001aP3the normal bundle sequence 0 //TX//TP3jX//O(4)jX//0andc2(P3) = c 2(O(1)\b4)(use the Euler sequence) immediately yield c2(X)2Z\u0001c2 1(O(1)jX). For a Kummer surface one simply uses the fact that away from the 16rational curves C1;:::;C 16corresponding to the16two-torsion points, the tangent bundle of Xis, after pull-back to the blow-up of the abelian surface in the two-torsion points, isomorphic to the tangent bundle of the abelian surface. The latter is trivial and thus only points on the Ci,i= 1;:::; 16, contribute to c2(X). However, as explained in the proof, [x] =cXfor any point contained in a rational curve."

In [ 255] it was seen as evidence for the Bloch\u2013Be\u02d8 \u0131linson conjecture for K3 surfaces over number fields, because a spherical object on XCfor a K3 surfaceXover \u0016Qis always defined over \u0016Q.

Questions and open problems: It would be interesting to find a di\ufb00erent approach to the torsion of CH2(X)via the torsion of K(X)in the case of non-separably closed fields k. Nothing seems to be known in this direction. More generally, it would be interesting to see whether viewing CH\u0003(X)asK(X)orK(Db(X)) sheds new light on certain aspects of cycles on K3 surfaces. For example, in [ 256] it is shown that the Bloch\u2013Be\u02d8 \u0131linson conjecture is equivalent to the existence of a bounded t-structure on the dense subcategory spanned by spherical objects. In [616] Voisin conjectures that for a complex projective K3 surface Xand any two closed pointsx;y2Xthe two points (x;y);(y;x)2X\u0002Xsatisfy [(x;y)] = [(y;x)]inCH4(X\u0002X).

The converse has recently been proved by Liedtke in [ 371], answering a question by Artin in [16, p. 552], see Section 18.3.5.1 Parts of this chapter are based on a seminar during the winter term 2011/12. I wish to thank the participants, in particular Stefanie Anschlag and Michael Kemeny, for stimulating discussions and interesting talks on the subject. 1As was pointed out to me by Christian Liedtke, it is a priori not clear that a uniruled K3 surface is in fact unirational, but see the arguments in the proof of Proposition 9.4.6. 255"

(i) Every polarized K3 surface (X;H )2Md(C)contains at least one rational curve C2jHj. (ii) The generic polarized K3 surface (X;H )2Md(C)contains a nodal integral rational curveC2jHj. (iii) For fixed n > 0, the generic polarized K3 surface (X;H )2Md(C)contains an integral rational curve C2jnHj. Proof. Toprove(i), onestartswithaKummersurface X0associatedwithanabelian surface of the form E1\u0002E2. We choose elliptic curves E1andE2such that there exists an isogeny ':E1//E2of degree 2d+ 5. To be completely explicit, one could take E1=C=((2d+ 5)Z+iZ)andE2=C=(Z+iZ)with'the natural projection. Let now \u0000:= \u0000'\u001aE1\u0002E2be the graph of 'and let C1\u001aX0 be the strict transform of its quotient \u0000=\u0006by the standard involution on E1\u0002E2."

For this one needs the existence of closed points b2Bsuch that the specialization NS(X) //NS(Xb) is an isomorphism, see Remark 17.2.16. The following results prove the conjecture in Remark 0.3 in many cases. It does not, however, address the stronger Conjecture 0.2, except when the Picard number is one. The first part is due to Bogomolov, Hassett, and Tschinkel [ 68] and the second to Li and Liedtke [358]. Theorem 3.4. LetXbe a K3 surface defined over an algebraically closed field kof characteristic zero. Then Xcontains infinitely many integral rational curves if one of the following conditions holds:"

By Theorem 1.7, one knows that for a generic quartic all rational curves in this linear system are nodal (with exactly three nodes) and by (4.1) that there are precisely 3200of them. All this seems to have been known classically, going back to Salmon, and can be verified by means of the Gauss map :X //X\u0003; x //TxX: 8According to [ 234, IV.Exer. 2.3], the generic sextic C\u001aP2contains 72flexes (or inflection points), i.e. pointsx2Csuch that the intersection multiplicity of TxCwithCatxis at least three. Generically only flexes of multiplicity three occur and a line `=TxC\u001aP2of a flex is not tangent to Cat any other point. 9Recall that the degree of the discriminant divisor in jOP3(4)jis108, see Section 17.1.4. Is there a geometric interpretation for the curious equality 324 = 3\u0001108?"

The existence of an elliptic K3 surface that is generic in this sense is proved by a dimension argument on a degeneration. In order to get density on the generic K3 surfaces, one rigidifies the rational curves on these elliptic K3 surfaces and uses again the theory of stable maps. 5.2.Theorem 5.1 compares nicely with the following result of Mclean [ 383].

It seems likely that density of rational curves in elliptic surfaces as proved by Bogomolov and Tschinkel in [ 69] continues to hold in positive characteristic, but details would need to be checked. As mentioned in the introduction, Bogomolov apparently had asked back in 1981 whether every \u0016Q-rational point of a K3 surface defined over a number field lies on a rational curve. There does not seem to be much evidence for this, but attempts to disprove it have also failed, see for example the first version of [ 30]. Of course, this would immediately imply Conjecture 12.2.5. As a consequence of Lemma 17.2.6 one knows that all smooth rational curves on X\u0002\u0016k, of which there might be infinitely many, live over a finite extension K=k. In many cases, the degree ofK=kcan be universally bounded. Is this still true for singular rational curves?"

For the remaining case see [448]. \u0003 2. Orthogonal group Next, we collect some standard facts concerning the group of automorphisms O(\u0003)of a lattice \u0003. So by definition O(\u0003)is the group of all g: \u0003\u0018\u0000 //\u0003with (g(x):g(y)) = (x:y) for allx;y2\u0003. Clearly, O(\u0003)is a discrete subgroup of the real Lie group O(\u0003R)' O(n+;n\u0000). In particular, if \u0003is definite, then O(\u0003R)is compact and, therefore, O(\u0003)is finite. The theory of automorphs of binary quadratic forms may serve as a motivation. In modern terms, one considers a lattice \u0003of rank two, which can also be thought of as a quadratic equation ax2+2bxy+cy2witha;b;c2Z, and an automorph is nothing but an elementg2O(\u0003)(sometimes assumed to have det(g) = 1). Interestingly, O(\u0003)can be finite even for indefinite \u0003. In fact, it is finite if and only if d:=\u0000disc \u0003 =b2\u0000ac> 0, is a square, which is equivalent to the existence of 06=x2\u0003with (x)2= 0. The idea behind this assertion is to link elements g2O(\u0003)to solutions of Pell\u2019s equation x2\u0000dy2= 1,"

For any\u000e2\u0001one defines the reflection s\u000e:x //x+ (x:\u000e)\u000e which is an orthogonal transformation, i.e. s\u000e2O(\u0003). Clearly,s\u000e=s\u0000\u000e. The subgroup W:=hs\u000ej\u000e2\u0001i\u001aO(\u0003) is called the Weyl group of\u0003. See also the discussion in Section 8.2.3. For\u0003 =U, the Weyl group is the proper subgroup Z=2Z\u001aO(U)'(Z=2Z)2generated by the reflection se\u0000f:e //f. Theorem2.2. Let\u0003be the K3 lattice E8(\u00001)\b2\bU\b3.

Embeddings of Picard, transcendental, and Kummer lattices The above discussion shall now be applied to Picard and transcendental lattices of K3 surfaces. The first question here is which lattices can be realized at all. Later we discuss the case of Kummer surfaces and in particular the Kummer lattice containing all exceptional curves."

For example, if Xis an elliptic K3 surface with a section, then the existence of a Hodge isometry T(X)'T(X0) impliesX'X0.

In Chapter 16we will be interested in derived equivalences between K3 surfaces. This will require the following modification of the above, which turns out to work without any restriction on the Picard number.

By Corollary 3.5, for which we needXto be projective, the standard embedding T(X)\u001aH2(X;Z)di\ufb00ers from the composition T(X) \u007f//U(2)\b3 \u007f//H2(X;Z) by an isometry of H2(X;Z)and, therefore, also the former contains Kin its orthogonal complement, i.e. there exists a primitive embedding K \u007f//T(X)?= NS(X).

In particular, one can consider the positive cone C \u001a II1;25 R(one of the two connected components of the set of all xwith (x)2>0) and its chamber decomposition. A fundamental domain for the action of the Weyl group WofII1;25, i.e. one chamber C0\u001aC, can be described in terms of Leech roots. A Leech root is a(\u00002)-class\u000e2II1;25 such that (\u000e:e) = 1fore2Uthe first basis vector of the standard basis of U. Then 6The lattices are usually listed according to their Coxeter number, so that 0, the root lattice of the Leech lattice, would be the last one in the list and A1(\u00001)\b24the penultimate."

It can be constructed as the set N\u001aRQof all vectors of the form1 2Pnieiwithni2Zand such that (\u0016n1;:::; \u0016n24)2F24 2is an element of the (extended binary) Golay code W\u001aF24 2, i.e. W=N=R\u001aR\u0003=R'F24 2: By definition, the Golay code Wis a12-dimensional linear subspace with the property that for all 06=w= (wi)2Wone hasjfijwi6= 0gj\u0015 8. The subspace Wcan be written down explicitly and it is unique up to linear coordinate change, see e.g. [ 130]. Remark 4.9. The only roots in this Niemeier lattice are the elements \u0006ei. Hence the Weyl group of Nis(Z=2Z)\b24. Viewing the symmetric group S24, as usual, as a subgroup of GL(F24 2), one defines the Mathieu group as (see also Section 15.3.1) M24:=f\u001b2S24j\u001b(W) =Wg: It is a simple sporadic group of order jM24j= 244:823:040 = 210\u000133\u00015\u00017\u000111\u000123: Proposition 4.10.

The following argument has been taken from Cartan\u2019s [ 102]. Consider a small open ball around x= 02U\u001aC2. We first show that there are coordinates (z1;z2)withf(z1;z2) =d0f\u0001(z1;z2). Defineg(y):= (1=n)Pn i=1(d0f)\u0000i\u0001fi(y)and checkd0g= (1=n)Pn i=1(d0f)\u0000id0(fi) = id. Hence, (z1;z2):=g(y)can be used as local coordinate functions around 0. Then note g(f(y)) = (1=n)nX i=1(d0f)\u0000i\u0001fi+1(y) = (d0f)\u0001 (1=n)nX i=1(d0f)\u0000i\u00001\u0001fi+1(y)! =d0f\u0001g(y): Thus, with respect to the new coordinate system (z1;z2) =g(y), we can think of fas the linear map d0fand, after a further linear coordinate change, f(z1;z2) = (\u00151z1;\u00152z2). Now deduce from f2Auts(X)that det(d0f) = 1, i.e.\u0015x:=\u00151=\u0015\u00001 2, and from jfj=nthat\u0015xis ann-th root of unity. If \u0015k x= 1for somek < n, thenfk= idin a neighbourhood of xand hencefk= idglobally. Contradiction. Hence, every \u0015xis a primitiven-th root of unity. \u0003 In particular, the fixed point set of a non-trivial symplectic automorphism of a complex K3 surface consists of a finite set of reduced points. This does not hold any longer in positive characteristic, see Remark 1.9. Mukai in [ 428, Sec. 1] deduces from this the following result, see also [ 447, Sec. 5]."

AUTOMORPHISMS VIA PERIODS 317 ii) If\u001a(X) = 2, then according to [ 490, Sec. 7] (see also [ 196, Cor. 1]): Aut(X)is finite if and only if there exists 06= 2NS(X)with ( )2= 0or( )2=\u00002, see the discussion in Sections 14.2,8.3.2, and Example 8.4.9. In [451] Nikulin carried out the classification for \u001a(X) = 3, in particularjF3j= 26, see also [454]. The case \u001a(X) = 4is due to Vinberg and was only published many years later in [615], where it is also shown that jF4j= 14.

In fact, a K3 surface Xwith\u001a(X) = 20is a rational double cover of a Kummer surface Yassociated with the product of two elliptic curves E1\u0002E2(see Example 11.1.2 and Remark14.3.22) and often Xitself is of this form. For Y, translation by a non-torsion section ofY //P1=E1=\u0006is an automorphism of infinite order.

Similarly, for (Shioda) supersingular (or, equivalently, unirational) K3 surfaces, i.e. K3 surfaces with \u001a(X) = 22(see Section 18.3.5), the group Aut(X)is as well infinite, see [274].

LetXbe a complex projective K3 surface with Pic(X)'Z\u0001H. Then (2.4) Aut(X) =\u001afidgif(H)2>2 Z=2Zif(H)2= 2: Proof. By Corollary 3.3.5, anyf2Aut(X)acts as\u0006idonT(X). On the other hand,f\u0003= idonNS(X), for the pull-back of the ample generator Hhas to be ample. But the action of f\u0003on the discriminant groups AT(X)and onANS(X)'Z=(H)2Zcoincide under the natural isomorphism, cf. Lemma 14.2.5. For (H)26= 2this excludes f\u00036= id onT(X). Hence,f\u0003= idonH2(X;Z)and Proposition 2.1 yields the result. If(H)2= 2, thenXis a double plane (see Remark 2.2.4) and the covering involution i:X\u0018\u0000 //Xindeed acts as\u0000idonT(X).

So everyLGcan in fact be embedded into the particular Niemeier lattice N1with root latticeA1(\u00001)\b24, but in order to embed LG\bA1(\u00001)others are needed. In the derived setting one rather uses embeddings into the Leech lattice, see Remark 3.9. ii) The proof also shows that any of the finite groups occurring in Theorem 3.1 can in fact be realized as a group of symplectic automorphisms acting on a K3 surface Xof maximal Picard number \u001a(X) = 20. This can also be seen as a consequence of the fact that automorphisms of polarized K3 surfaces specialize, see Section 5.2.3. 3.4.The starting point for Nikulin\u2019s approach to the classification of finite abelian groups of symplectic automorphisms, which was later extended by Xiao in [ 636] to the non-abelian case, is the following proposition.

This provides probably the easiest way to produce examples of K3 surfaces with infinite Aut(X). Indeed, take the Kummer surface associated with E1\u0002E2 and assume \u001a(X)>18, e.g.E1'E2. Its Mordell\u2013Weil rank is positive due to the Shioda\u2013Tate formula 11.3.4, cf.

The proof actually reveals that for derived equivalent K3 surfaces X andYeitherX'YorXis isomorphic to a moduli space of stable sheaves of positive rank onY, i.e.X'MHY(v)s. In [253] it has been shown that in the latter case Xis in fact isomorphic to a moduli space of \u0016-stable(!) vector bundles(!) on Y. Using more lattice theory, the above result can also be stated as follows. Corollary 3.7. Two complex projective K3 surfaces XandYare derived equivalent if and only if there exists a Hodge isometry T(X)'T(Y)between their transcendental lattices."

Reasoning as for complex K3 surfaces with their singular cohomology, one finds that \bPinduces an (ungraded) isomorphism H0 \u0013et(\u0016X;Q`)\bH2 \u0013et(\u0016X;Q`(1))\bH4 \u0013et(\u0016X;Q`(2)) 'H0 \u0013et(\u0016Y;Q`)\bH2 \u0013et(\u0016Y;Q`(1))\bH4 \u0013et(\u0016Y;Q`(2)) which is compatible with the Frobenius action. If i;jand i;jdenote the eigenvalues of the Frobenius action on Hi \u0013et(\u0016X;Q`)and Hi \u0013et(\u0016Y;Q`), respectively, then the isomorphism shows f 0;1; 2;1 q;:::; 2;22 q; 4;1g=f 0;1; 2;1 q;:::; 2;22 q; 4;1g: But, clearly, 0;1= 0;1and 4;1= 4;1and hencef 2;j=qg=f 2;j=qg. Conclude by using the Weil conjectures, see Theorem 4.4.1. \u0003 Remark 4.7. Note that the same principle applies to derived equivalences for higher- dimensional varieties XandYover a finite field Fq. However, the induced identification between various sets of eigenvalues of the Frobenius is not enough to conclude equality of their zeta functions. This corresponds to the problem in characteristic zero that for derived equivalent varieties XandYone knowsP p\u0000q=ihp;q(X) =P p\u0000q=ihp;q(Y)for allibut not whether the individual Hodge numbers satisfy hp;q(X) =hp;q(Y). 3This proof was prompted by a question of Mircea Musta\u0163\u0103."

In fact, in [ 608] Verbitsky shows that two very general non-projective complex K3 surfaces XandYhave equivalent abelian categories Coh(X)'Coh(Y). 5. Appendix: Twisted K3 surfaces It has turned out to be interesting to introduce the notion of twisted K3 surfaces. This works in both, the algebraic and the analytic setting. Definition 5.1. Atwisted K3 surface (X; )consists of a K3 surface Xand a Brauer class 2Br(X). The notion makes sense for arbitrary Xand a general theory of sheaves on (X; ), so called twisted sheaves, can be set up. This is of particular importance for K3 surfaces. There are various ways of defining twisted sheaves and the abelian category Coh(X; ) of those, but they all require an additional choice, either of an Azumaya algebra A, of a \u010cech cycle representing or aGm-gerbe. The following is copied from [ 254]."

Which lattices can be realized depends very much on the field k. Moreover, the N\u00e9ron\u2013Severi lattice can grow under base change to a larger field. We pay particular attention to finite fields and number fields. Before starting, we mention in passing a characteristic pversion of the injectivity c1: NS(X) \u007f//H1;1(X)for complex K3 surfaces, see Section 1.3.3. AsH1;1(X)and also the de Rham cohomology H2 dR(X)are vector spaces over the base field, the first Chern class must be trivial on p\u0001NS(X). For a proof of the following statement, see Ogus\u2019 original in [ 475, Cor. 1.4] or the more concrete in [ 511, Sec. 7] or [ 604, Sec. 10]. Proposition 2.1.

One also knows that for a K3 surface XoverQwith good reduction at p6= 2the cokernel of sp: Pic(X\u0016Q) //Pic(X\u0016Fp)is torsion free. In [ 168, Thm. 1.4] Elsenhans and Jahnel deduce this from a result of Raynaud [ 505], which applies to K3 surfaces over discrete valuation rings of unequal characteristic and ramification index <p\u00001. 2.6.We next shall discuss K3 surfaces defined over number fields. Clearly, any K3 surfaceXover \u0016Qis isomorphic to the base change of a K3 surface defined over some number field. It is however a non-trivial task to determine the number field or even its degree. The following is an observation going back to Shioda and Inose in [ 565]. For more information on the field of definition k0see Sch\u00fctt [ 534] and Shimada [ 551]. Proposition 2.14. LetXbe a K3 surface over an algebraically closed field kof charac- teristic zero. If \u001a(X) = 20, thenXis defined over a number field, i.e. there exists a K3 surfaceX0over a number field k0, an embedding k0 \u007f//k, and an isomorphism X'X0\u0002k0k: Moreover, we may assume that base change yields Pic(X0)\u0018\u0000 //Pic(X). Proof. In [565] the assertion is reduced to Kummer surfaces via Remark 15.4.1, but this can be avoided. It is enough to show that Xcan be defined over \u0016Qfor some embedding \u0016Q \u007f//k. Consider a base L1;:::;L 20ofPic(X). We may assume that X and allLiare defined over a finitely generated integral \u0016Q-algebraA. In particular, Xis defined over the quotient field Q(A)ofA. After spreading and localizing Aif necessary, one obtains a smooth family X //Spec(A)of K3 surfaces with line bundles L1;:::;L20. Specialization yields injections Pic(X\u0016k)'Pic(X\u0016\u0011) \u007f//Pic(Xt) forallclosedpoints t2Spec(A). Thus,X //Spec(A)isasmoothfamilyofK3surfacesof maximal Picard number \u001a= 20."

As mentioned already at the end of , there are no K3 surfaces that are known not to be DPC. For elliptic K3 surfaces X //P1over finite fields, the Tate conjecture for Xis equi- valent to the function field analogue of the Birch\u2013Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture for the generic fibre E=X\u0011, see [593, 602 ] or Remark 18.2.9 for more details and a more general version. 3.1.K3 surfaces, as abelian varieties, have always served as testing ground for fundamental conjectures. This was the case for the Weil conjectures and is certainly also true for the Tate conjecture. For many K3 surfaces the Tate conjecture had been verified in the early eighties, but the remaining cases have only been settled recently. Due to the e\ufb00ort of many people (see below for precise references), one now has: Theorem 3.4. The Tate conjecture holds true for K3 surfaces in characteristic p6= 2. 3.2.In characteristic zero, the Tate conjecture for K3 surfaces follows from the Tate conjecture for abelian varieties proved by Faltings and the Lefschetz theorem on (1;1)-classes. This is a folklore argument, see [ 7, Thm. 1.6.1] or [ 592, Thm. 5.6], which we reproduce here. For number fields the proof is due to Tankeev [ 581], who proves a Lie algebra version of Tate\u2019s conjecture asserting that NS(X\u0002ks) Q`is the part of H2 \u0013et(X\u0002ks;Q`(1))invariant under the Lie algebra of the Galois group.

The proofs in [ 396, 108 ] deal only with the remaining supersingular K3 surfaces, whereas in [ 385] there is no need to distinguish between supersingular and non-supersingular K3 surfaces. The more recent paper of Charles [109] contains another approach, in spirit closer to the paper by Artin and Swinnerton-Dyer. See Section 18.2.3 for more information. Note that in order to prove the Tate conjecture over arbitrarily finitely generated fields in positive characteristic, it is indeed enough to prove it for finite fields, see [ 57, Prop. 2.6]. 3.4.An immediate consequence of the Tate conjecture is that the Picard number of a K3 surface over a finite field is always even, see Corollary 2.9. Here is another consequence Corollary 3.7. LetXbe a K3 surface over an algebraically closed field of characteristic \u00153. ThenXis supersingular if and only if \u001a(X) = 22. Proof. Since\u001a(X)\u001422\u00002h(X)for K3 surfaces of finite height, see Lemma 18.3.6, any K3 surfaces of maximal Picard number \u001a(X) = 22has to be supersingular. For the converse assume that Xis defined over a finite field Fq. Using the arguments in the proof of Theorem 18.3.10, one finds that the action of the Frobenius on H2 \u0013et(X\u0002\u0016Fq;Q`(1))is of finite order and after passing to a certain finite extension Fqrwe can even assume it is trivial."

Classically it is also known that in general per( )6= ind( ), see e.g. Kresch\u2019s example of a three-dimensional variety in characteristic zero in [ 327], and the notorious period-index problem asks under which conditions per( ) = ind( ). For function fields of surfaces and for surfaces over finite fieldsthishasbeenaddressedbydeJong[ 135]andLieblich[ 364]. Inparticular, per( ) = ind( )for Brauer classes 2Br(X)with per( )prime toqon K3 surfaces over Fq. Also note that for complex K3 surfaces one always has per( ) = ind( ), see [268]. 2See [403, IV Prop. 1.4] for the generalization of the Skolem\u2013Noether theorem to Azumaya algebras over arbitrary rings which is needed here."

The result is usually attributed to Gabber but the only available proof is de Jong\u2019s [ 134].

See [ 546, Ch. X.5]. ii) More generally, H2(X;Gm)is torsion if Xis regular and integral. Indeed, in this case the restriction to the generic point of Xdefines an injection Br(X) \u007f//Br(K(X)); see [403, IV.Cor. 2.6], and the latter group is torsion.

Finiteness of Brauer group This section is devoted to finiteness results and conjectures for Brauer groups of K3 surfaces over finitely generated fields k. Most of the results hold in broader generality, but, due to the vanishing of various cohomology groups of odd degree, the picture is often simpler for K3 surfaces.

Although, Picard number and height are intimately related via the inequality (3.4), their behavior as a function on Mdis very di\ufb00erent. Whereas h(X)\u0015h is a closed condition, the condition \u001a(X)\u0015\u001ais not, it rather defines a countable union of closed sets.
